# Huffman_File_Compressor
This program showcases an implementation of a Huffman compression algorithm computed in Ada.

## How It's Made:

**Tools used:** Ada, C++

This implementation of the Huffman Compression Algorithm showcases the intricacies of Ada in comparison to other high leveled programming langauges through the development of a compression algorithm. This project in particular heavilty utilizes Ada's 'Strong Typing' and explicit type conversions, as well as Ada's built-in priority queue and interface packages.
